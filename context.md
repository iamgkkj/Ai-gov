# AI-Gov Development Context Log

## Project Overview
- Project: AI-Gov
- Description: DAO governance tool with AI analysis and voting.

## Changes Log

### Backend Setup (14-07-2025)
- Change: Set up FastAPI backend with main.py for proposal handling, AI integration, DB, IPFS.
- What's working: Proposal submission endpoint, AI analysis stubs.
- What's not: Full smart contract integration, error handling.
- Yet to implement: Full integrations, testing.

### Backend API Enhancement (16-07-2025)
- Change: Refactored main.py to use modular services (database, AI, IPFS, blockchain).
- Added comprehensive API endpoints:
  - Proposal creation and retrieval
  - Voting functionality with AI delegate support
  - Delegate preferences management
  - Full proposal data with votes and blockchain status
- What's working: Complete API structure with error handling and async operations.
- What's not: Actual service implementations need to be tested.
- Yet to implement: Testing with real blockchain, IPFS, and AI services.

### Smart Contract (14-07-2025)
- Change: Created AIGov.sol smart contract with proposal and voting functionality.
- What's working: Basic proposal submission and voting logic.
- What's not: Testing, deployment, and integration with frontend.
- Yet to implement: Contract deployment, testing.

### Frontend Setup (15-07-2025)
- Change: Set up React frontend with TailwindCSS, Wagmi, and RainbowKit.
- Created core components:
  - App.js with routing
  - Navbar and Footer components
  - Dashboard page with statistics and recent proposals
  - SubmitProposal page with multi-step form
  - ProposalFeed page with filtering options
  - ProposalDetail page with voting interface
  - VotingPanel page with AI delegate integration
  - DelegateSetup page for configuring AI voting preferences
- What's working: UI components with mock data.
- What's not: Integration with backend API and smart contracts.
- Yet to implement: Real data fetching, wallet integration testing.

## Next Steps
- Test the backend services with actual implementations
- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete application

## Recent Updates (Current)
- Fixed Gemini API authentication by properly passing the API key to ChatGoogleGenerativeAI constructor
- Updated AI service to use RunnableSequence instead of deprecated LLMChain
- Implemented database fallback mechanism to use SQLite in-memory database when PostgreSQL is unavailable
- Updated README with clear instructions for Gemini API setup and database configuration
- Added error handling for missing API keys and database connection failures

## Completed Tasks
- Connect frontend to backend API (Created API client in frontend/src/services/api.js)
- Set up environment variables and configuration (.env.example created)
- Create deployment scripts (backend/run.py, frontend/start.js, setup.ps1, contracts/scripts/deploy.js)
- Implement frontend integration with the backend API
- Update documentation (README.md) with setup and running instructions
- Create Hardhat configuration for smart contract deployment
- Migrate from OpenAI to Google's Gemini API for AI analysis services
- Fix Gemini API authentication by properly configuring API key in both direct and LangChain implementations
- Add database fallback mechanism to use SQLite in-memory database when PostgreSQL is not available

## Server Setup and Issue Resolution
- Updated `run.py` and `main.py` in the backend to change `HOST` from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost`.
- Updated the root `.env` file to change `HOST` from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost`.
- Installed required Python packages for the backend using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Successfully started the backend server at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Started the frontend server using `npm start`.
- Resolved `ReferenceError: configureChains is not defined` in `frontend/src/App.js` by adding the missing import.
- Confirmed both frontend and backend servers are running successfully, with source map warnings noted as non-critical.
