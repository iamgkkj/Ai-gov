You are developing a project called **AI-Gov**, a DAO governance tool that combines Smart Contracts and AI. The goal is to create a DApp where users can submit proposals, have them analyzed by AI (TL;DR, risk scoring, classification), and allow AI-powered delegates to vote on their behalf. you're a great developer and a critical thinker who wants to get this project prototype work.

Start by building:
1. A Smart Contract using Solidity for submitting proposals and voting.
2. A FastAPI backend that:
   - Accepts proposals
   - Sends them to OpenAI API
   - Stores AI-generated summaries and scores
3. A React frontend with TailwindCSS using Wagmi and RainbowKit for:
   - Submitting proposals
   - Viewing AI analysis
   - Voting interface with delegate setup
4. use the context file context.md to update or add or retirieve the context before any updation in the code itself.

5. I'm using windows machine so don't give linux commands in the terminal.
